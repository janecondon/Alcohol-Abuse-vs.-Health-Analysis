# Analysis of Alcohol Abuse and its Relation to Mental and Physical Health in the United States


## Introduction

This project involves an analysis of data from the CDC'S Behavioral Risk Factor Survey (BRFSS) from 2018. The purpose of this project is to answer these two questions: "What is the extent of alcohol abuse in the United States?", and "How do mental and physical health influence the likelihood of someone engaging in binge drinking?"  Multiple techniques, such as an exploratory data analysis, logistic regression, and data visualization will be utilized to predict the likelihood of individuals engaging in binge drinking based on their mental and physical wellbeing.
 

## Data

The data used in this project comes directly from the CDC's Behavioral Risk Factor Survey [BRFSS](https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/annual_data/annual_2018.html) from 2018.

#### How is Alcohol Abuse Measured?

In this project, I looked at three different measures of alcohol abuse: prevalence, intensity, and frequency.

* **Prevalence**: This refers to the percentage of adults in a given state who have consumed a certain number of alcoholic beverages on at least one occasion in the past 30 days. This can be 4 or more drinks for women, or 5 or more drinks for men.

* **Intensity**: This refers to the maximum number of alcoholic beverages consumed on a single occasion among those who binge drink, in the past 30 days.

* **Frequency**: This refers to the average number of ‘binge drinking’ occasions among those who binge drink, in the past 30 days.
